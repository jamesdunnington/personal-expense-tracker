# âœ… Frontend Fixed!

## Issue Resolved

The frontend wasn't loading due to a Tailwind CSS version conflict.

### Problem
- Tailwind CSS v4 changed how it integrates with PostCSS
- The PostCSS plugin was moved to a separate package `@tailwindcss/postcss`
- This caused the frontend to fail loading

### Solution
- Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3 (stable version)
- This version works perfectly with the existing PostCSS setup
- No breaking changes to your code
