- Generates JWT token

**File: `netlify/functions/auth-login.js`**
- Handles user login
- Verifies credentials
- Generates JWT token

### 2. Updated Frontend API URLs

**Before:**
```javascript
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:3000/api'
```

**After:**
```javascript
const API_URL = import.meta.env.PROD 
  ? '/.netlify/functions'  // Production: Netlify Functions
  : 'http://localhost:3000/api'  // Development: Local backend
```

### 3. Updated API Endpoints

- ✅ `/auth/register` → `/.netlify/functions/auth-register`
- ✅ `/auth/login` → `/.netlify/functions/auth-login`
