# Authentication System - Working ✅

## Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

### What's Working:
- ✅ User Registration (with email/password)
- ✅ User Login (with JWT token generation)
- ✅ Automatic default categories creation (14 categories)
- ✅ Automatic default tags creation (3 tags)
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT token authentication (7-day expiration)
- ✅ Environment variables configured on Netlify
- ✅ Serverless functions deployed and working
- ✅ Frontend correctly calling Netlify Functions
- ✅ Works on both desktop and mobile

### Test Account:
- Email: cshnyt@gmail.com
- Password: 430191-Nytcsh
- Status: Active in Neon database

### Technical Details:

#### Backend (Netlify Functions):
- `netlify/functions/auth-register.js` - User registration
- `netlify/functions/auth-login.js` - User login
- Database: Neon PostgreSQL (withered-scene-59786903)
- Environment Variables: DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET (configured in production)

#### Frontend:
- Login Page: `src/pages/Login.jsx`
- Register Page: `src/pages/Register.jsx`
- API Service: `src/services/api.js`
- Auth Service: `src/services/index.js`

#### Key Fix Applied:
Changed API URL detection from `import.meta.env.PROD` to `window.location.hostname` check:
```javascript
const isProduction = window.location.hostname !== 'localhost' && window.location.hostname !== '127.0.0.1'
const API_URL = isProduction ? '/.netlify/functions' : 'http://localhost:3000/api'
```

This ensures the frontend correctly calls Netlify Functions in production instead of trying to reach localhost.

### Production URLs:
- Site: https://melodic-florentine-c45b71.netlify.app
- Login: https://melodic-florentine-c45b71.netlify.app/login
- Register: https://melodic-florentine-c45b71.netlify.app/register

### Database Schema Deployed:
All 8 tables created in Neon:
1. users
2. categories (with hierarchical structure)
3. tags
4. transactions
5. recurring_rules
6. transaction_tags (junction table)
7. import_history
8. ai_settings

### Default Categories Created on Registration:
**Income Categories:**
- Display Ads (subcategories: AdSense, Mediavine, Other Display)
- Affiliate Marketing (subcategories: Amazon Associates, Other Affiliate)
- Sponsored Content
- Other Income

**Expense Categories:**
- Equipment
- Software & Tools
- Marketing & Ads
- Professional Services
- Travel & Transport
- Office Supplies
- Education
- Meals & Entertainment
- Other Expenses

**Default Tags:**
- personal
- business
- tax-review

### Next Steps:
1. Build Transaction Management (CRUD operations)
2. Connect Dashboard to real data
3. Implement Category Management UI
4. Add Reporting System
5. Configure PWA features
